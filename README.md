   # Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The Gaming Room client wishes to create a game names Draw It or Lose It, which allows for users to come together and guess what a picture is from a preloaded picture. This software needs to be on iOS, Android, and PC. The client wishes us to develop a software that allows for cross-platform play, and allow for login credentials. This software also needs to allow for either single player or multiplayer.
   # What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   I believe I did a good job on creating the software design document and explaining the different OS types in the document.
   # What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   When working through a design document, having the structure and generally easy to understand questions of the document can help in the first stages of developing code when you dont have a good idea of what needs to be done.
   # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   I would like to revise on the language used in the document, as I believe that I could have been more descriptive in certain areas of the document. Being descriptive can help with envisioning the future of the software being built.
   # How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I had to interpret the user's needs by looking at it from a user's point of view. This helps especially when coming up with how the UI should look and interact with the user. By doing this, I can see the software from a user's point of view instead of a devs point of view. Being able to translate ideas into an actual program is an important part of the software development lifecycle.
   # How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   I approached the designing process of this software by reading the requirements set out for me and imagining how the software would look in the end. Also, creating some type of schedule when designing software like Draw It or Lose It proves to be extremely helpful. In the future, I will use a design document to make sure I understand the requirements given by the client.
